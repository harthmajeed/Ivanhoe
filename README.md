This is a team project that was done in the "Object-Oriented Software Engineering" university course in 2016.

The game was completed by 2 other team members mentioned in the documenation.

My task was to work on the GUI, this was the first intensive project I worked on, and first time in Java, learned many things that stuck with me over the years.
